Running the chr programs
========================

Start swi-prolog, and load the correct file with the use_module
command, e.g.:

use_module(sudoku_chr_ovp).

Then you can invoke the solve predicate on the name of a sudoku,
e.g.:

solve(expert).

There is also a solveall predicate which runs and times the
execution of each sudoku automatically. It only makes sense to run this with sudoku_chr, because sudoku_chr_ovp does not work on every
sudoku and sudoku_chr_channeling does not work at all.

solveall.
